Preprocessor to include (copy) files into other files.


## Include Syntax

JavaScript
~~~
// @include "some/file.js"
// @include 'some/other/file.js'
~~~

Those lines will be replaced with the content of the target files. The lookup
is always relative to the file containing the `@include` line. Supports
globbing.


## Install

~~~sh
> npm install includeit
~~~


## Usage

~~~javascript
var includeit = require('includeit');
var newContent = includeit(options);
~~~

with

~~~javascript
options = {
    // a full file path for relative lookup (does not need to exist)
    file: undefined,

    // and the file's content
    content: undefined,

    charset: 'utf-8'
}
~~~
